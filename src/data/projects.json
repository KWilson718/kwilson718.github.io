Designed to store formatted data about a miniature wargaming collection, Miniature Collection Manager allowed for the rapid itemization of a large inventory of game pieces for the wargaming hobby. Past the core concept, I was able to gain immense familiarity with how React works, as well as experience with building an application that used the component library MUI.",
